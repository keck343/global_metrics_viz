# Global Metrics of Economic Prosperity and Health
### A Data Visualization Project

I wanted to explore how country’s economies affect other measures of prosperity, such as healthcare outcomes.  While I expect wealth to generally be correlated with better outcomes, the outliers are of particular interest.  What countries either have a lot of economic power and poorer healthcare outcomes or less economic power and better than expected healthcare outcomes?  I explored how countries’ wealth and trading have shifted over time and finally compared it with infant mortality rates. It was then natural to explore healthcare systems as part of an explanation of why certain countries didn’t have infant mortality rates that seemed aligned with their credit scores.  I pulled in data on each country’s universal healthcare systems in order to better understand which countries might have unusually high or low infant mortality rates.
