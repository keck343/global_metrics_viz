There are a myriad of factors that go into any one country’s outcomes in economics, healthcare, and other markers of global competitiveness. A high credit score or GDP does not always mean better outcomes in healthcare, as there are many other factors at play. One important indicator is the infant mortality rate. It is important to examine why countries might be outliers, either having a high infant mortality rate despite good economic indicators or having a surprisingly low infant mortality rate despite economic indicators.
